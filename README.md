Group messaging server over SMS

Run on a Heroku Server, allows groups to create a group sms system when Whatsapp is not going to work.

Send the first message with just your name to the number, this registers your number and name so that every message you then send is prefixed with your name. Your next message is then broadcast to every registered number as an SMS. All responses are then broadcast to all group members.
